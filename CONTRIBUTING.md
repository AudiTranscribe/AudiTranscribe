# Contributing to AudiTranscribe

## Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to AudiTranscribe. AudiTranscribe is a small project, and it's people
like you that make it such a great tool.

Following these guidelines communicates that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open
source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping
you finalize your pull requests.

## What To Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to AudiTranscribe. There are three **big** types of contributions we are looking our
for:

- Improving the documentation
- Improving the design of the application
- Fixing bugs **OR** improving efficiency of the program

In addition, feature requests and bug reports are greatly appreciated. They help make AudiTranscribe a better tool and
more stable for users to use.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure how to begin? There are a few places you can find issues for the project.

- [`Todo.txt`](Todo.txt). This is the old way of making down what needs to be done in the project. In the future, we'll
  hopefully migrate all of these to the issue tracker on GitHub.
- The [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Ryan-Kan/AudiTranscribe/issues). This is the new (and main) way of
  obtaining the issues that we need help with. If you're looking for something to contribute, try:
    - Beginner issues: Issues that should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two
    - Help Wanted issues: Issues that are more involved

## Submitting Contributions

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it, send a pull request!

However, for small issues such as

- spelling / grammar fixes
- typo correction, white space and formatting changes
- comment clean up

you could submit an issue instead of a pull request.

**NOTE: (Development) changes to *AudiTranscribe* should _never_ be pushed to the `main` branch**. The `main` branch
should be reserved for production builds.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug within AudiTranscribe, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/Ryan-Kan/AudiTranscribe/issues)
on the issue tracker. We recommend using the issue template to aid us in fixing the bug.

## Suggesting Features/Enhancements

Features and enhancements are welcome! We are always looking for ways to improve AudiTranscribe and to make it a better
application for everyone to use.

We have a philosophy for what we do in AudiTranscribe:

- We believe that AudiTranscribe should be easy to use and easy to install.
- It should not be cumbersome for new users to install AudiTranscribe.
- Code written in AudiTranscribe should be easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to amend.

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in AudiTranscribe, you are probably not alone. There are
probably many others who have thought of adding such a feature into AudiTranscribe. Open an issue on our issues list on
which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
