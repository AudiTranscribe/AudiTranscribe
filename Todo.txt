Todo:
    - Add JPackage capability
    - Update README.md
    - BPM Selection and Estimation
    - Menu GUI
    - Allow other audio types (e.g. mp3) to be input into the program
    - Add progress bars
    - Implement file saving
        - We would probably save the spectrogram data as that takes the longest to generate
    - Add licence/credits for ionicons
    - Add keyboard shortcuts
    - Add progress bar support
