Todo:
    - Add JPackage capability
    - Update README.md
    - BPM Selection and Estimation
        - Before estimation is implemented, allow user to select BPM and show beats lines updating
    - Menu GUI
    - Allow audio to play alongside spectrogram
    - Implement file saving
        - We would probably save the spectrogram data as that takes the longest to generate
    - Add licence/credits for ionicons
    - Add keyboard shortcuts

Fixme:
    - Fix weird interactions between playback buttons:
        - "Stop -> Skip Forwards -> Play" should play from beginning immediately, but instead nothing plays
