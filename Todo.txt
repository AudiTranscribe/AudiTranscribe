Todo:
    - Add JPackage capability
    - Possibly allow for bicubic interpolation
    - Update README.md
    - Validate audio length
    - Implement file saving
        - We would probably save the spectrogram data as that takes the longest to generate

Fixme:
    - Spectrogram seems to be very noisy...
        - NOT problem with audio sample processing, FFT, STFT, or VQT
