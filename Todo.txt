Todo:
    - Add Launch4j capability to generate JAR files (or .exe files)
    - Implement CQT (based off of VQT)
    - Possibly allow for bicubic interpolation
    - Fix spectrogram generation code
        - Fix magnitude to 'packet' conversion
    - Update README.md
    - Validate audio length

Fixme:
    - Spectrogram image seems to have artifacts
