# Welcome!

Welcome to the official AudiTranscribe documentation site!

AudiTranscribe is a free, open-source music transcription application. It aims to provide a free alternative to the
expensive professional transcription apps that many may not be able to afford.

To the left you'll find all the different documentation sections. Below you'll find a high level overview of the docs,
to help you get your bearings.

To get started, we recommend checking out the [Setup Instructions](setup/installing-auditranscribe.md). Or, if
you already have AudiTranscribe installed on your device, check out the [Tutorial](tutorial/1-first-project.md).

Here's a rundown of the different sections (the section links point to the first page of each section):

| Section                            | Description                                                                  |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Setup](setup/introduction.md)     | Follow these steps to set up AudiTranscribe on your device.                  |
| [Tutorial](tutorial/0-overview.md) | Learn the essentials on how to use AudiTranscribe.                           |
