Fixme:
    - Issue on Windows: no line matching interface SourceDataLine supporting format PCM_SIGNED 44100.0 Hz, 16 bit,
      stereo, 4 bytes/frame, little-endian is supported.
    - Note playing is delayed.
        - Temporary fix is to implement a fixed constant to account for delay, but a more permanent fix is needed.
        - This also causes some notes to not play at the start of playback.
    - Sometimes BPM does not update the note lines automatically.
    - Failure to delete auxiliary files on Windows (and on Linux).
        - The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process
