Fixme:
    - Note playing is delayed.
        - Temporary fix is to implement a fixed constant to account for delay, but a more permanent fix is needed.
        - This also causes some notes to not play at the start of playback.
    - Playhead line desync / spectrogram scroll failure has not been resolved.
        - It triggers very inconsistently, how to cause it to trigger reliably?
