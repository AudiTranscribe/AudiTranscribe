Fixme:
    - Note playing is delayed.
        - Temporary fix is to implement a fixed constant to account for delay, but a more permanent fix is needed.
        - This also causes some notes to not play at the start of playback.
    - Check if commons-lang3 is still needed (in light of JavaTuples).
