Fixme:
    - Issue on Windows: no line matching interface SourceDataLine supporting format PCM_SIGNED 44100.0 Hz, 16 bit,
      stereo, 4 bytes/frame, little-endian is supported.
    - Note playing is delayed.
        - Temporary fix is to implement a fixed constant to account for delay, but a more permanent fix is needed.
        - This also causes some notes to not play at the start of playback.
    - MIDI player has several bugs to fix.
        - Sometimes notes do not play.
            - Attempting to play notes once the MIDI sequence ended (but before audio ends) will result in notes not
              being played
        - Need to fix MIDI timing.
            - Some notes will not play if they are next to each other.
        - Prevent note rectangles from overlapping.
