Fixme:
    - Note playing is delayed.
        - Temporary fix is to implement a fixed constant to account for delay, but a more permanent fix is needed.
        - This also causes some notes to not play at the start of playback.
    - Spectrogram duration/alignment seems off.
        - See "The Deep.wav".
    - Playhead line desync has not been resolved.
