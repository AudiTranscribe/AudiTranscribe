Fixme:
    - Issue on Windows: no line matching interface SourceDataLine supporting format PCM_SIGNED 44100.0 Hz, 16 bit,
      stereo, 4 bytes/frame, little-endian is supported.
    - Note playing is delayed.
        - Temporary fix is to implement a fixed constant to account for delay, but a more permanent fix is needed.
        - This also causes some notes to not play at the start of playback.
    - Sometimes confirmation of the "unsaved changes" dialog appears more than once.
    - Memory leak issue may not be completely fixed.
        - Does this cause the above issue?
