These SVG files were adapted from https://clarity.design/icons.

The design of the icons are the same as those used in those SVG files, but the content have been changed in order to be
compatible with JavaFX.

Used https://thednp.github.io/svg-path-commander/convert.html to convert the SVG files into a more compatible format for
use in JavaFX.
